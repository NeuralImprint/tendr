# tendr
Tendr is an event service platform designed to streamline event planning. It features a user-friendly dashboard for managing personal info, upcoming events, favorites, and vendors. The platform offers tools for easy event planning, personalized recommendations, and vendor browsing. I am developing a responsive UI, with separate modules for login, signup, and homepage interfaces to ensure a seamless and interactive user experience.
